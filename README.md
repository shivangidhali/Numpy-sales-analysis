# Numpy-sales-analysis
"A basic sales analysis, using Numpy statistical analysis, filtering, transformation and aggregation."
This is a basic **Sales Analysis project using Numpy**, created as part of my Data Analytics learning journey,
the project demonstrates how to generated data, perform statistical analysis, filter data and extract insights.

## Step Covered 
1- Data generation 
2- Basic statistical analysis(mean, median, max, min, std)
3- Data filtering
4- Data transformation and Aggregation

## Insights Explored 
1- Count of days with above-average sales
2- Sales values of days with above-average sales
3- Count of Target sales days (Target sales values between 400-450)
4- Target sales value of those days.

## Tools used
- Python
- Numpy
- VS code

## Project Insights
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Numpy arrays, slicing, filtering 
and aggregation techniques.
